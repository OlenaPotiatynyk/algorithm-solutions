// ## 2037. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone
//
// There are n available seats and n students standing in a room. You are given an array seats of length n, where seats[i] is the position of the ith seat. You are also given the array students of length n, where students[j] is the position of the jth student.
// You may perform the following move any number of times:
// Increase or decrease the position of the ith student by 1 (i.e., moving the ith student from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)
// Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.
// Note that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.

//
// ðŸ§  **Algorithm:** Greedy
// ðŸŸ¢ **Difficulty:** Easy
// ðŸ“„ **Explanation**: Greedy assignment after sorting ensures optimal pairing.
//
// **Approach**: Sort both arrays and sum absolute differences.
// **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) (due to sorting)
// **Space Complexity**: O(1) (in-place sorting)
//
// **Why itâ€™s interesting**: A classic example of pairing strategy + greedy reasoning.
